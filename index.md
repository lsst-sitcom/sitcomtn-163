# Source Selection for Abell 360 in ComCam Data

```{abstract}
We cover the source selection done for the Abell 360 ComCam cluster study focusing on color and photo-z cuts. We present basic photometric validation and offer an independent validation suite for photo-z work. The various cuts are then used to generate N(z)s and shear profiles. We find that both cuts are quite robust to various choices made and can produce a shear profile for Abell 360.
